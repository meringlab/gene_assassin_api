#>P	YDR026C	YDR026C	YDR026C	IV	492559	494268	-1	RNA polymerase I termination factor; binds to rDNA terminator element, required for efficient Pol I termination; required for rDNA silencing at NTS1; facilities association of Sir2p with NTS1, contributes to rDNA stability and cell longevity; interacts physically with Fob1p and RENT subunits, Sir2p and Net1p; may interact with ribosomes, based on co-purification experiments; Myb-like DNA-binding protein; NSI1 has a paralog, REB1, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000002433]
