#>P	YLR442C	YLR442C	YLR442C	XII	1019318	1022251	-1	Silencing protein; interacts with Sir2p, Sir4p, and histone H3 and H4 tails to establish transcriptionally silent chromatin state; required for spreading of silenced chromatin; recruited to chromatin through interaction with Rap1p; C-terminus (residues 840-978) assumes variant winged helix-turn-helix (wH) fold that mediates homodimerization, which is critical for holo-SIR complex loading; SIR3 has a paralog, ORC1, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004434]
