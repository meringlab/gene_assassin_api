#>P	YBL039C	YBL039C	YBL039C	II	143992	145728	-1	Major CTP synthase isozyme (see also URA8); catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the amide nitrogen from glutamine to UTP, forming CTP, the final step in de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines; involved in phospholipid biosynthesis; capable of forming cytoplasmic filaments termed cytoophidium, especially during conditions of glucose depletion; URA7 has a paralog, URA8, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000135]
