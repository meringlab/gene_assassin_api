#>P	YGL228W	YGL228W	YGL228W	VII	67598	69328	1	Protein involved in outer spore wall assembly; likely involved directly in dityrosine layer assembly; putative GPI-anchored protein; overexpression causes growth arrest; SHE10 has a paralog, OSW7/YFR039C, that arose from the whole genome duplication and deletion of both SHE10 and OWS7 results in reduced dityrosine fluorescence from the spore wall relative to other mutants [Source:SGD;Acc:S000003197]
