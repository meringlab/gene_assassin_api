#>P	YDR143C	YDR143C	YDR143C	IV	742045	743874	-1	Ubiquitin-protein ligase; involved in proteasome-dependent degradation of aberrant nuclear proteins; targets substrates with regions of exposed hydrophobicity containing 5 or more contiguous hydrophobic residues; contains intrinsically disordered regions that contribute to substrate recognition; prefers a window of exposed hydrophobicity that causes a particular level of protein insolubility, suggesting that San1p evolved to target highly aggregation-prone proteins [Source:SGD;Acc:S000002550]
