#>P	YBR086C	YBR086C	YBR086C	II	420204	423041	-1	Cortical ER protein involved in ER-plasma membrane tethering; one of 6 proteins (Ist2p, Scs2p, Scs22p, Tcb1p, Tcb2p, Tcb3p) that connect ER to the plasma membrane (PM) and regulate PM phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) levels by controlling access of Sac1p phosphatase to its substrate PI4P in the PM; localizes to the mother cell in small-budded cells and to the bud in medium- and large-budded cells; mRNA is transported to the bud tip by an actomyosin-driven process [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000290]
