#>P	YGR188C	YGR188C	YGR188C	VII	872047	875109	-1	Protein kinase involved in the cell cycle checkpoint into anaphase; in complex with Mad1p and Bub3p, prevents progression into anaphase in presence of spindle damage; Cdc28p-mediated phosphorylation at Bub1p-T566 is important for degradation in anaphase and adaptation of checkpoint to prolonged mitotic arrest; associates with centromere DNA via Skp1p; involved in Sgo1p relocalization in response to sister kinetochore tension; paralog MAD3 arose from whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000003420]
