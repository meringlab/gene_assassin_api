#>P	YPR154W	YPR154W	YPR154W	XVI	834565	835209	1	Negative regulator of actin nucleation-promoting factor activity; interacts with Las17p, a homolog of human Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), via an N-terminal SH3 domain, and along with LSB1 cooperatively inhibits the nucleation of actin filaments; short-lived protein whose levels increase in response to thermal stress; induces the formation of the [PIN+] and [RNQ+] prions when overproduced; PIN3 has a paralog, LSB1, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000006358]
