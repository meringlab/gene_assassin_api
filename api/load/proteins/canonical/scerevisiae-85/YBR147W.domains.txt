#>P	YBR147W	YBR147W	YBR147W	II	536575	537462	1	Putative vacuolar membrane transporter for cationic amino acids; likely contributes to amino acid homeostasis by exporting cationic amino acids from the vacuole; positive regulation by Lys14p suggests that lysine may be the primary substrate; member of the PQ-loop family, with seven transmembrane domains; similar to mammalian PQLC2 vacuolar transporter; RTC2 has a paralog, YPQ1, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000351]
