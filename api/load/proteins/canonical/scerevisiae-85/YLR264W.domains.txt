#>P	YLR264W	YLR264W	YLR264W	XII	673131	673331	1	Protein component of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit; homologous to mammalian ribosomal protein S28, no bacterial homolog; has an extraribosomal function in autoregulation, in which Rps28Bp binds to a decapping complex via Edc3p, which then binds to RPS28B mRNA leading to its decapping and degradation; RPS28B has a paralog, RPS28A, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004254]
