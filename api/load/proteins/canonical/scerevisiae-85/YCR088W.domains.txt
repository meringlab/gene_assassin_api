#>P	YCR088W	YCR088W	YCR088W	III	265068	266843	1	Actin-binding protein of the cortical actin cytoskeleton; important for activation of the Arp2/3 complex that plays a key role actin in cytoskeleton organization; inhibits barbed-end actin filament elongation; phosphorylation within its Proline-Rich Regio, mediated by Cdc28p and Pho85p, protects Abp1p from proteolysis mediated by its own PEST sequences; mammalian homologue of HIP-55 (hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 [HPK1]-interacting protein of 55 kDa) [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000684]
