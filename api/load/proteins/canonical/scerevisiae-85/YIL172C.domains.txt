#>P	YIL172C	YIL172C	YIL172C	IX	16787	18553	-1	Alpha-glucosidase; weak, but broad substrate specificity for alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosides; member of IMA isomaltase family; not required for isomaltose utilization, but Ima3p overexpression allows the ima1 null mutant to grow on isomaltose; lower activitiy and thermostability in vitro than Ima2p despite sequence difference of only 3 amino acids; cleaves alpha-1,3 linkage of nigerose and turanose, but not alpha-1,5 of leucrose; identical to IMA4 [Source:SGD;Acc:S000001434]
