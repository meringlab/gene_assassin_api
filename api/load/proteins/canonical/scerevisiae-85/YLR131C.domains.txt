#>P	YLR131C	YLR131C	YLR131C	XII	404513	406822	-1	Transcription factor required for septum destruction after cytokinesis; phosphorylation by Cbk1p blocks nuclear exit during M/G1 transition, causing localization to daughter cell nuclei, and also increases Ace2p activity; phosphorylation by Cdc28p and Pho85p prevents nuclear import during cell cycle phases other than cytokinesis; part of RAM network that regulates cellular polarity and morphogenesis; ACE2 has a paralog, SWI5, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004121]
