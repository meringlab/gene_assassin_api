#>P	YMR192W	YMR192W	YMR192W	XIII	647118	649277	1	Putative GTPase activating protein (GAP) with a role in exocytosis; stimulates Gyp5p GAP activity on Ypt1p, colocalizes with Gyp5p at sites of polarized growth; interacts with Gyp5p, Rvs161p, and Rvs167p; involved in recruiting Rvs167p to the bud tip during polarized growth; increases in abundance and relocalizes from bud neck to cytoplasm upon DNA replication stress; GYL1 has a paralog, GYP5, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004804]
