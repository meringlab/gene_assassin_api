#>P	YLR160C	YLR160C	YLR160C	XII	486204	487289	-1	Cell-wall L-asparaginase II involved in asparagine catabolism; expression induced during nitrogen starvation; ORF contains a short non-coding RNA that enhances expression of full-length gene; likely arose in via horizontal gene transfer from the wine yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus or a close relative; reference strain S288C has four copies of ASP3; ASP3-4 has a paralog, ASP3-2, that arose from a segmental duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004150]
