#>P	YOR294W	YOR294W	YOR294W	XV	868340	868948	1	Essential protein that binds ribosomal protein L11; required for nuclear export of the 60S pre-ribosomal subunit during ribosome biogenesis; localizes to the nucleolus and in foci along nuclear periphery; cooperates with Ebp2p and Mps3p to mediate telomere clustering by binding Sir4p, but is not involved in telomere tethering; mouse homolog shows altered expression in Huntington's disease model mice [Source:SGD;Acc:S000005820]
