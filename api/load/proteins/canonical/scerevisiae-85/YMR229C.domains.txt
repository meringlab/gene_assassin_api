#>P	YMR229C	YMR229C	YMR229C	XIII	725937	731123	-1	RNA binding protein involved in synthesis of both 18S and 5.8S rRNAs; component of both the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) processosome and the 90S preribosome; acts as part of a Mak21p-Noc2p-Rrp5p module that associates with nascent pre-rRNA during transcription and has a role in bigenesis of the large ribosomal subunit; has binding preference for single stranded tracts of U's; relocalizes from nucleolus to nucleus upon DNA replication stress [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004842]
