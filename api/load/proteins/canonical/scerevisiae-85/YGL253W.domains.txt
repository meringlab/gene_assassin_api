#>P	YGL253W	YGL253W	YGL253W	VII	23935	25392	1	Hexokinase isoenzyme 2; catalyzes phosphorylation of glucose in the cytosol; predominant hexokinase during growth on glucose; functions in the nucleus to repress expression of HXK1 and GLK1 and to induce expression of its own gene; antiapoptotic; phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at serine-14 by protein kinase Snf1p and protein phosphatase Glc7p-Reg1p regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Hxk2p; HXK2 has a paralog, HXK1, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000003222]
