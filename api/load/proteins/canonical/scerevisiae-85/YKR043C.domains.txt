#>P	YKR043C	YKR043C	YKR043C	XI	520900	521712	-1	Sedoheptulose bisphosphatase involved in riboneogenesis; dephosphorylates sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate, which is converted via the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway to ribose-5-phosphate; facilitates the conversion of glycolytic intermediates to pentose phosphate units; also has fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase activity but this is probably not biologically relevant, since deletion does not affect FBP levels; GFP-fusion protein localizes to the cytoplasm and nucleus [Source:SGD;Acc:S000001751]
