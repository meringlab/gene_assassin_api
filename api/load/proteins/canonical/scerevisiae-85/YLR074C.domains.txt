#>P	YLR074C	YLR074C	YLR074C	XII	281959	282456	-1	C2H2-type zinc finger protein required for ribosome assembly; shuttling factor which associates with pre-60S particles in the nucleus, accompanying them to the cytoplasm; cytoplasmic dissociation of Bud20p requires Drg1p; N-terminus harbors a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES); cytoplasmic Bud20p is reimported by Kap123-dependent pathway; involved in bud-site selection; diploid mutants display a random budding pattern; similar to human ZNF593 [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004064]
