#>P	YDL042C	YDL042C	YDL042C	IV	376760	378445	-1	Conserved NAD+ dependent histone deacetylase of the Sirtuin family; involved in regulation of lifespan; plays roles in silencing at HML, HMR, telomeres, and the rDNA locus; negatively regulates initiation of DNA replication; functions as a regulator of autophagy like mammalian homolog SIRT1, and also of mitophagy; SIR2 has a paralog, HST1, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000002200]
