#>P	YMR186W	YMR186W	YMR186W	XIII	632355	634469	1	Cytoplasmic chaperone of the Hsp90 family; plays a role in determining prion variants; redundant in function and nearly identical with Hsp82p, and together they are essential; expressed constitutively at 10-fold higher basal levels than HSP82 and induced 2-3 fold by heat shock; contains two acid-rich unstructured regions that promote the solubility of chaperone-substrate complexes; HSC82 has a paralog, HSP82, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004798]
