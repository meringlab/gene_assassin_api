#>P	YPR104C	YPR104C	YPR104C	XVI	733626	736433	-1	Regulator of ribosomal protein (RP) transcription; has forkhead associated domain that binds phosphorylated proteins; recruits coactivator Ifh1p or corepressor Crf1p to RP gene promoters; also has forkhead DNA-binding domain though in vitro DNA binding assays give inconsistent results; computational analyses suggest it binds DNA directly at highly active RP genes and indirectly through Rap1p motifs at others; suppresses RNA pol III and splicing factor prp4 mutants [Source:SGD;Acc:S000006308]
