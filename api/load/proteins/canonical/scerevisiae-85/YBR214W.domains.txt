#>P	YBR214W	YBR214W	YBR214W	II	651415	652995	1	Protein involved in cell separation during budding; one of two S. cerevisiae homologs (Sds23p and Sds24p) of the S. pombe Sds23 protein, which is implicated in APC/cyclosome regulation; may play an indirect role in fluid-phase endocytosis; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress; SDS24 has a paralog, SDS23, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000000418]
