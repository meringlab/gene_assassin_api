#>P	YLR262C	YLR262C	YLR262C	XII	668247	668891	-1	Rab family GTPase; Ras-like GTP binding protein involved in the secretory pathway, required for fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the late Golgi, maturation of the vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y; resides temporarily at the Golgi, dissociates into cytosol upon arrival of the Rab GTPaseYpt32p, which also functions in the late Golgi; Golgi-localized form is bound to GTP, while cytosolic form is GDP-bound; homolog of the mammalian Rab6 [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004252]
