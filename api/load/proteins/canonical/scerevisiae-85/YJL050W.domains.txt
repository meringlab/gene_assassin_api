#>P	YJL050W	YJL050W	YJL050W	X	342522	345740	1	ATP-dependent 3'-5' RNA helicase of the DExD/H family; involved in nuclear RNA processing and degradation both as a component of TRAMP complex and in TRAMP-independent processes; TRAMP unwinds RNA duplexes, with Mtr4p unwinding activity stimulated by Pap2p/Air2p but not dependent on ongoing polyadenylation; contains an arch domain, with two coiled-coil arms/stalks and a globular fist/KOW domain, which has RNA binding activity and is required for 5.8S rRNA processing [Source:SGD;Acc:S000003586]
