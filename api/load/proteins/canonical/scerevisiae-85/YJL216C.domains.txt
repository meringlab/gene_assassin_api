#>P	YJL216C	YJL216C	YJL216C	X	24344	26086	-1	Alpha-glucosidase; specificity for isomaltose, maltose, and palatinose, but not alpha-methylglucoside; most distant member of the IMA isomaltase family, but with similar catalytic properties as Ima1p and Ima2p; not required for isomaltose utilization, but Ima5p overexpression allows the ima1 null mutant to grow on isomaltose; can cleave alpha-1,3 linkage of nigerose and turanose and alpha-1,5 linkage of leucrose and is very sensitive to temperature in vitro [Source:SGD;Acc:S000003752]
