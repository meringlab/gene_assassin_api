#>P	YLR164W	YLR164W	YLR164W	XII	493883	494386	1	Putative alternate subunit of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH); mitochondrial inner membrane protein; genetic interaction with SDH4 suggests that Shh4p can function as a functional SDH subunit; a fraction copurifies with SDH subunit Sdh3p; expression induced by nitrogen limitation in a GLN3, GAT1-dependent manner; Shh4p has greater similarity to human SDHD (subunit D of SDH, implicated in paraganglioma) than does its paralog Sdh4p [Source:SGD;Acc:S000004154]
