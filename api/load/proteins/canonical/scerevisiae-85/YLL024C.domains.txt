#>P	YLL024C	YLL024C	YLL024C	XII	95569	97485	-1	ATP-binding protein; involved in protein folding and vacuolar import of proteins; member of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family; associated with the chaperonin-containing T-complex; present in the cytoplasm, vacuolar membrane and cell wall; 98% identical with paralog Ssa1p, but subtle differences between the two proteins provide functional specificity with respect to propagation of yeast [URE3] prions and vacuolar-mediated degradations of gluconeogenesis enzymes [Source:SGD;Acc:S000003947]
