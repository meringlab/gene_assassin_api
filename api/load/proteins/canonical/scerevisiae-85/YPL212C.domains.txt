#>P	YPL212C	YPL212C	YPL212C	XVI	151518	153149	-1	tRNA:pseudouridine synthase; introduces pseudouridines at positions 26-28, 34-36, 65, and 67 of tRNA; also acts on U2 snRNA; also pseudouridylates some mRNAs, and pseudouridylation level varies with growth phase; nuclear protein that appears to be involved in tRNA export; PUS1 has a paralog, PUS2, that arose from the whole genome duplication [Source:SGD;Acc:S000006133]
