#>P	YOL021C	YOL021C	YOL021C	XV	282424	285426	-1	Exosome core complex catalytic subunit; has both endonuclease and 3'-5' exonuclease activity; involved in 3'-5' RNA processing and degradation in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm; role in degradation of tRNAs; has similarity to E. coli RNase R and to human DIS3; mutations in Dis3p corresponding to human mutations implicated in multiple myeloma cause phenotypes suggesting impaired exosome function; protein abundance increases in response to DNA replication stress [Source:SGD;Acc:S000005381]
