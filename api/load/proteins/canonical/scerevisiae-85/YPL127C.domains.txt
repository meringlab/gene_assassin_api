#>P	YPL127C	YPL127C	YPL127C	XVI	308831	309604	-1	Histone H1, linker histone with roles in meiosis and sporulation; decreasing levels early in sporulation may promote meiosis, and increasing levels during sporulation facilitate compaction of spore chromatin; binds to promoters and within genes in mature spores; may be recruited by Ume6p to promoter regions, contributing to transcriptional repression outside of meiosis; suppresses DNA repair involving homologous recombination [Source:SGD;Acc:S000006048]
